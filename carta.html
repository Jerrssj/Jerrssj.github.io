              <strong>Dear Abby..</strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
                Forgive me if my words have hurt you like thorns, bringing back
                memories we promised to overcome together.<br />
                It was never my intention to hurt you… but my stupid mind is a
                mess beyond repair, it sometimes acts without thinking and ends
                up hurting the one I love the most… you.<br />
                It hurts to see how, little by little, I’ve been pushing you
                away. And now I understand why so many people have walked away
                from me.<br />
                But you… you, my beloved girl, have been the only one who has
                stayed by my side. Despite everything, you keep finding reasons
                why what we have is worth it, even when I feel completely
                lost.<br />
                In three days we’ll be together for 10 months, and you say that
                means something. And I’m starting to believe it too… thanks to
                you.<br />
                You were there to catch me when I was falling, to give me
                reasons to keep going. Thank you for not giving up on me, for
                loving even the broken parts of me.<br /><br />

                I’m sorry for not being able to calm your fears… especially the
                ones I caused.<br />
                I feel guilty, and regret is not enough...<br />
                I’ve been a bad partner, I admit it. And I’m aware that I don’t
                deserve someone like you…<br />
                But even so, I want to be by your side, to take care of you, to
                love you with sincere gestures, and to show you that time and
                distance are no excuse not to treat you as what you are: a
                queen… an angel, my blessing.<br />
                I ask for your forgiveness, and please, accept this gift as a
                reminder of how much I love you.<br />
                I’m here for you, to catch you if you fall, to give you strength
                if you feel weak…<br /><br />

                You’ve always done that for me, so I would do it for you.<br />
                Tell me what you need — I give myself to you honestly.<br />
                I’m not asking you to change your mind, only to show you how
                much I regret everything, and how deeply grateful I am for every
                moment with you.<br />
                That intimate moment we shared was beautiful… to me, you are
                art,<br />
                and the woman I want by my side for the rest of my life.<br /><br />

                Thank you for making my life a better, upgraded version.<br />
                With lots of <strong>code</strong> and
                <strong>love</strong>,<br />
                Your stupid and lost programmer, only yours…<br /><br />
